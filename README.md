# Coinsquare take home - Take home

Front end assessment for Coinsquare. Built from "scratch" with 
no app scaffolding used. Time to complete was about 5 hours with many coffee breaks. The app can be previewed at https://coinbase-take-home.firebaseapp.com/ 

## Technologies used
- React / Redux
- Npm
- Webpack
- Jest/Enzyme for tests

## Commands
- test - run unit tests
- start - run dev server
- build - create a production build (default "dist" folder)
- deploy - deploy app to firebase
- firebase-init - Init firebase application (run from terminal)

## Considerations
- App has no function RESTful API component (bitfinex blocks CORS requests). An intermediary microservice would solve this issue but is outside the scope of the assessment
- Unit tests are limited due to time constraints. 100% coverage would have been ideal
